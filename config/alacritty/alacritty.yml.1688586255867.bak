# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
# env:
# TERM env customization.
env:
  TERM: xterm-256color
# If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
#
# Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
# You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
# `infocmp xterm-256color`.
# TERM: xterm-256color-italic

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
